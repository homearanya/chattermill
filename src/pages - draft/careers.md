      - On a personal and a professional level, we are motivated by taking on new challenges â€” even if they seem initially out of reach!  We recognise that we are learning machines and we always seek to action feedback and improve.  We are not afraid of trying new things and making mistakes, and we make sure we are learning from them. Together, we aim to find new ways to scale and achieve our vision.

We trust our colleagues to have the right intentions and knowledge.  We don't micromanage but we are not afraid to have open discussions if there's disagreement.  We always assume good intent and appreciate the value of open dialogue and good judgement.

    text:
      - We've come together to build something that has never been done before.  While we're an ambitious bunch with lofty goals, we don't approach this goal recklessly.  We take a measured approach and don't promise what we don't know we can deliver.  We take risks but we consider the consequences and keep a clear strategy in mind.

      - At Chattermill we have learned that any of our important achievements have been a result of people working together. We respect our teammates and commit to team decisions even when we disagree. We are happier working in a team than by ourselves even if this is required on occasion. We always hire and promote with the team in mind.
